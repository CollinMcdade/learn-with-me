# Learn With Me!

This repository will be my attempt to distrubted a condensed version of any topics that interest me!

If you want to learn any of these topics I will be documenting my own learning journey which may help you as well!



(This will act as notes when a section is in progress, therefore due to the ephemeral nature of said notes I will simply be commiting to main for now... aka: no branches you'll need to worry about)
